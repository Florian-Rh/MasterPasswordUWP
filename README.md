# MasterPasswordUWP
UWP (Universal Windows Platform) implementation of Lyndir's open source project 'Master Password App' (https://github.com/Lyndir/MasterPassword)
 
Tested on Windows 10 Mobile. Should also run on Windows 10 Desktop, Xbox and Hololens.

This is a C# implementation of the open source Master Password Algorithm created by Maarten Billemont and Lyndir  (http://masterpasswordapp.com/algorithm.html). 

Key derivation was achieved using BioTurboNick's PBKDF-Library 'Skryptonite' for UWP (https://github.com/BioTurboNick/Skryptonite).

Master Password App is an awesome app that calculates passwords based on a master password and other easy to remember parameters. For more information see http://masterpasswordapp.com/
